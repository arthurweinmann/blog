My content is currently in the folder [web/articles](web/articles). To make it your own, fork this project after starring it :), remove all files in [web/articles](web/articles) and start writing your own articles in markdown. 

Finally, you can edit the release script here [.github/scripts/release.sh](.github/scripts/release.sh) to make github push on your own server.
