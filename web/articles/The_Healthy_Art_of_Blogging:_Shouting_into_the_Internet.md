# The Healthy Art of Blogging: Shouting into the Internet

You've felt it. The impulse to unleash your inner thoughts and observations about the latest global issue or maybe just the age-old debate of pineapple on pizza. The siren call of social media, promising instant feedback and maybe, just maybe, a viral moment. But as we all know, that road often leads to misunderstandings, arguments, and an overwhelming urge to throw your device into the nearest body of water. I believe sharing one's thoughts and observations is important to the advancement of society as a whole. Perhaps ideas are similar to waves spreading into the matter of connected humans and interfering with each other to create new ideas and so on. It is interesting to think that ideas are the real deal and we are just here to convey them, but I won't go this far. Anyway, here's why blogging might just be the therapeutic outlet we need in this digital age.

# Your Space, Your Rules

Unlike the constraining nature of most social platforms and the energetic pressure it puts on you, a blog is your realm. Want to gush about how banana peels might be sentient? Go ahead. Want to share a detailed analysis on why socks disappearing in the dryer could be proof of a parallel universe? More power to you. Without the pressures of likes, shares, or real-time feedback, a blog is an uncensored space for pure expression.

# Therapeutic Writing

Crafting a well-thought-out blog post can be meditative. It allows us to organize our thoughts, and potentially arrive at insights we hadn't considered before. By taking the time to sit, ponder, and write, we practice mindfulness.

# A little help is OKAY

Many people are 100% against using large language models to write. I agree with one of their argument, which states that only by writing it yourself, you can gain new insights and understand more deeply a subject. When they are two extremes, the good spot is usually in the middle. The famous healthy compromise. The famous greek saying "everything in moderation". Perhaps moderation means that you still have to do or use it. You can use LLMs to get started writing or get a little help in the form of ideas and concepts from the internet, broken into pieces, and reassembled in the context of your query. This feels just like the next step in evolution after google search.

# Become a producer

Writing a blog post is an active contribution to the world of knowledge and ideas. It transforms you from a spectator, who takes in content, to a creator, who shapes and disseminates unique insights, perspectives, or stories. In essence, while consuming can be passive and often unidirectional, producing via blogging is an interactive and empowering act. It feels good.

Your blog post is not perfect? That is fine, put it out there anyway and improve it later after you stepped back from it. It is a good thing to have records on how you were thinking and writing about things in your past. This is a very clear way of encouraging our growth.

# Use it to laugh

Laughter is a natural stress-reliever. Instead of arguing about whether hotdogs are a sandwich (they're not, by the way), why not pen a witty post about the hilarious implications if they were?

# Becoming a Better Communicator

The process of blogging improves our communication skills. In order to make a point, we have to consider structure, tone, and delivery. This not only makes us better writers but can also translate into more effective verbal communication. I just started blogging and I intend to improve a lot thanks to it.
