# A unique opportunity for technological freedom

In a world increasingly dominated by technological advancements and locked-in systems, the right to universal access to a personal, Jarvis-like engineering companion could prove transformative. This AI-powered personal assistant, modeled after the iconic Jarvis from the Marvel universe, should be able to help anyone not only to interact with, but also to understand and manipulate technology freely.

With this assistant, everyone could break free from proprietary technologies that limit user freedom and innovation. It would enable users to seamlessly interact with any system or technology, without being confined to specific brands or platforms. The AI would serve as an intermediary, translating human instructions into machine language and vice versa, across a range of different devices and operating systems.

By making this a universal right, we would empower every individual to not only be consumers, but also creators and innovators, unrestricted by locked-in technology. This would democratize the ability to shape the technological environment according to one's own needs and preferences, eliminating barriers to entry and promoting a more inclusive digital future. 

This AI companion would also equip individuals with the understanding and control of their own data, enhancing their digital rights and privacy. As we march forward into an increasingly digital era, this universal right would significantly level the technological playing field, opening a world of opportunities for all, regardless of their technical background or financial capabilities.
