# College Applications consume 68215 human-years of work each year

Each year, highschool seniors spend a lot of time into their college applications: for their essays, standardized tests, filling out FAFSA information and planning for financial aid, filling college specific forms that on average require 40 information fields to be completed. 
Furthermore, students have to take part in associations, clubs, even NGOs in order to make their application stand out. But let's not consider those efforts since they are difficult to measure.

In the school year 2022-2023, 1 244 476 students applied for colleges, for a total of 7 057 980 applications (5.7 per student). On average, a student will spend between 60 and 200 hours working for their applications. Let's take 100 hours as our baseline. Let's consider that 97 hours are spend on work which is common to all applications (the essay is a big part of it but also the tests), and 3 hours spend specifically per college. Each year, colleges consume, only for their application process:

<b>1244476×97+7057980×3 = 141888112 hours = 5912004 days = (÷365.25) 16186 years of human work</b>.

This represents either: 

-   1 human working continuously without sleeping or doing anything else for 16186 years or,
-   16186 humans working continuously without sleeping or doing anything else for one year

Let's account for the fact that humans sleep and need to eat. We may also give our human some free time to enjoy. Such a human would work approximately 40 hours a week. In this configuration, a human-year of work is 2080 hours of actual work. With a more realistic definition of the human-year unit of work, we can say that colleges consume each year, only for their applications: <b>68215 human-year of work</b>.

# Is there a better way to use all this human intellect ?

Having a way to select applicants is necessary. Essays also bring value to the student writing it. Or at least, this was the case when this practice first started. It allows highschool seniors to look back at their accomplishements and to reflect on themselves and what their wishes for the future are. There are probably many other benefits to college essays. The issue is it went so much overboard. To the extreme! The lengths to which a highschooler will go to make their essay stand out is absurd today. The related stress. They could put some of this work into other pursuits as important for their future and for deciding what they want their future to look like.

This solution is far from perfect and honestly the first thing that crossed my mind hearing about the experience of a current applicant. What if, instead of writing essays, these 68215 human-years of work each year were put into writing wikipedia articles ? It can be an article about any subject. Seniors may choose the one they are the most interested in. It can be about a new subject not yet documented, it can be a summary of existing knowledge but linking different fields in a new way, or any other creative pursuit. Such a practice would help and advance humanity at the same time as providing a way to select students.

How about building a project ? A robot or a construction of some kind ? How about publishing the resulting blueprints and discoveries and experience on internet to benefit other people and projects and help build human knowledge landscape. It would help students learn about what they like to be creative about to better orient their college choice.

What about internships ? Or helping astronomers and physicists sort and analyze the collosal data amout telescopes and particle accelerators produce ? Those are only ideas I came up with on the spot. There are probably a lot more of even better ideas we could implement. Students could come up with their very own idea, one that looks like them, as long as it brings something to society. And by bringing something, we do not mean that the project or pursuit has to be fruitful, even a failure would be precious information and also a result. What counts is the trip, the research and not the destination.

# What about the examiners ?

It is common knowledge that an examiner will spend around 5 minute per application. This gives us 588165 hours and thus 588165/2080 = 282 human-year of work on the college side. It seems difficult to also repurpose those since you still need a way to evaluate what each student produced. Who knows, maybe we could find a way to measure the impact of the work of each student with an automatic system.

# Conclusion

We hear a lot about AI these days. I believe what AI means is more automatisation of non creative tasks. Some would argue AI can be creative, others that it just recombines pieces of concepts it encountered into something that appears new and creative to us because we are not able to mathematically model our language and ideas. Whichever it is, AI means human can more and more create creative value for society in the field they love. We could maybe have AI assistants to help students in their college application project and to help college examinate them.
